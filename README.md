# Basic tool for (gently) scraping public ETF data (across exchanges) from the (UK) [Morningstar] (http://tools.morningstar.nl/nl/etfquickrank/default.aspx?Site=NL&Universe=ETALL%24%24ALL&LanguageId=nl-NL) ETF Quickrank / Database .

Please note:

- scraping this website is only allowed for personal use (as per Morningstar's Terms and Conditions).
- this tool is structured in a such a way that it gently / ethically scrapes the pages it encounters (in other words, scraping data might take a bit longer given the couple of "sleep" intervals embedded in the code)
- you will have to point the browser variable to the local path of your webdriver
- though this scraper has specifically been built for the UK Morningstar website, it enables one to extract data from multiple non-UK universes (e.g. ETFs listed on the Xetra, Nasdaq etc)

This tool has been written by means of [Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/), [Selenium 3.4.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) and [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

Example of the resulting dataframe one might expect:

```
    TER                       category   close  \
0  0.15  Europe Large-Cap Blend Equity  260.39
1  0.15      US Large-Cap Blend Equity   39.34
2     -   Sector Equity Infrastructure       -
3     -     Property - Indirect Global   62.74
4     -                    Global Bond   55.92
